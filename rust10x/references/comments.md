# Comments Best Practices

Here are the Rust10x comments best practices that build upon Rust comment best practices.

Make sure to not add other comment styles for delimiting than those styles, except if the code already uses some patterns. 

## Comment Delimiters

Rust10x best practices include two main comment delimiters:

1. Code Region

```rust
// region:    --- Region Name

// endregion: --- Region Name
```
For larger code sections.

2. Code Section Marker

```rust
// -- Some Section Name
```

Typically used without a function body to section off lines of code. This does not have an end marker; it just indicates that from that point, the code block is about a specific section.

## Code Region

For large chunks of code, usually groups of types, functions, private/support code for a file, or a test section, use the code region formatted like this:

```rust
// region:    --- Region Name

// endregion: --- Region Name
```
- The `Region Name` is short, usually one or two words max.
- The spacing is important; it has to be exactly this number of spaces, for example, before and after the `---` to be fully aligned.
- These regions can be at the top level of a file or even within some function bodies if very large.

### Typical Code Regions

**In `main.rs`, `lib.rs`, and all `mod.rs` files:**

- There will be a code region at the top (after the eventual module comments `//!`) named `Modules`.
- This will contain all of the `mod ..` imports and reexports like `pub use sub_module::*` when appropriate.

**For Tests Block in Source Code Files:**

- As described in the `test-best-practices`, when unit tests are inlined in a source file, the `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block is wrapped in a `Tests` code region.

**Inlined Support Functions/Types:**

- Sometimes a source file will have some private functions specific to the file's logic. Before the eventual test code region, we have a `Support` code region with the private types/functions there.

## Code Section Marker

In function bodies or types, code section markers `// -- some concise description` can be used to further split the code.

- These markers do not have a closing marker and are just intended to indicate: "Below is about this."
